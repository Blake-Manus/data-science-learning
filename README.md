# Data Science Learning
A collection of work on datasets collected from Kaggle to improve my knowledge in the Data Science Field. Each project has its own unique goals outlined below. This code is constantly in a state of WIP as I learn more about the tools and algorithms used to improve my predictions.

# Titanic Dataset
* My first project (outside of the Iris Dataset) that I am currently working on while learning Data Science/Machine Learning to accurately predict who survived the historical event of the sinking of the Titanic. CSV Files printed within the code are meant to be submitted to Kaggle for grading of accuracy. The current most accurate method used is KNN.

* I am currently using this set as a test environment while continuing to learn the different types of Data Science Algorithms and their use cases. This code will be updated periodically.
