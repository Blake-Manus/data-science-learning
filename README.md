# Data Science Learning
A collection of work on datasets collected from Kaggle to improve my knowledge in the Data Science Field. Each project has its own unique goals outlined below. This code is constantly in a state of WIP as I learn more about the tools and algorithms used to improve my predictions.

# Titanic Dataset
* My first project (outside of the Iris Dataset) that I am currently working on while learning Data Science/Machine Learning to accurately predict who survived the historical event of the sinking of the Titanic. CSV Files printed within the code are meant to be submitted to Kaggle for grading of accuracy.
